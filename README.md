This repository demonstrates a potential issue with non-standard string concatenation in a COBOL program. The `bug.cob` file contains code that uses the `&` operator, which is not standard for string concatenation in COBOL. This can lead to portability issues and compiler errors.  The `bugSolution.cob` file shows the corrected code using the standard `INSPECT` or `STRING` verb for concatenation.
